Proceed as follows to add one or more accounts.

##### Activating a new account:

 1. Go to **Settings » Markets » eBay » OAuth accounts**.
 2. Select **Production** for the environment if the account should not be a test account.
 3. Click on  **Activate new account**.

 → The account will be displayed in the **OAuth accounts** menu.
    
When activating or updating an account, a token with a validity of 18 months will be generated. There will be no automatic warning at the end of the period of validity. The token will also become invalid when the eBay account data is changed.
